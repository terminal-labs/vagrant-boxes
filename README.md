The boxes are hosted at https://app.vagrantup.com/terminal-labs

See the documentation in the "box-docs" directory for information about the individual box classes.

At this time, this project requires the system package `unzip` be installed. This will be fixed in a later version.

Install this by cloning the repo and running `pip install -e .` inside it.
